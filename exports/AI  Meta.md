- **Execution Strategy**: PyCharm is more bloated than VSCode, but also easier to properly configure.
- **AI System Design**: Added central logging system to standardise error handling output across application.
- **AI System Design**: Centralising logging is important to ensure consistent formatting, destination and level settings using the logging python module.
- **AI System Design**: For tests regarding classes that interface with API, there must be a mix of tests for error handling using mocks, and integration tests in different tests.
- **AI System Design**: Test Isolation for Multi-Agent System is crucial so different AI can interact in the same world state.
- **AI System Design**: Reactive Programming is crucial to enable real-time model switching for different domains (programming, image creation, storytelling).
- **AI System Design**: Plugin-Based Modular Systems are important in order to ensure code base integrity and easier feature expansion.
- **AI System Design**: Event-driven architecture can enable more interactivity and tighter integration with IDE (see Cursot and Qodo).
- **AI System Design**: Tests are important to validate classes and helper functions and enable easier development

- **Meta Reflection**: Implemented testing using fixtures and pytesting to check modules and helper function that help with refactoring.
