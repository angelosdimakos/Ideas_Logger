- **Execution Strategy**: PyCharm is more bloated than VSCode, but also easier to properly configure.
- **AI System Design**: Added central logging system to standardise error handling output across application.
- **AI System Design**: Centralising logging is important to ensure consistent formatting, destination and level settings using the logging python module.
- **AI System Design**: For tests regarding classes that interface with API, there must be a mix of tests for error handling using mocks, and integration tests in different tests.
- **AI System Design**: Test Isolation for Multi-Agent System is crucial so different AI can interact in the same world state.
- **AI System Design**: Reactive Programming is crucial to enable real-time model switching for different domains (programming, image creation, storytelling).
- **AI System Design**: Plugin-Based Modular Systems are important in order to ensure code base integrity and easier feature expansion.
- **AI System Design**: Event-driven architecture can enable more interactivity and tighter integration with IDE (see Cursot and Qodo).
- **AI System Design**: Tests are important to validate classes and helper functions and enable easier development

- **Meta Reflection**: Implemented testing using fixtures and pytesting to check modules and helper function that help with refactoring.

- **Tooling & Automation**: Trying to make logic in order to track entries across days in order to properly summarize.

- **Tooling & Automation**: Will need to include a way to pick up on log phrasing and automatically generate a Gantt Chart.
- **Tooling & Automation**: Will need to reverse engineer a way for new entries to be tagged based on existing FAISS search.
- **AI System Design**: Will need to add mind map to logically link ideas together.

- **AI System Design**: Will need to include emotion detection from sentiment analysis to better prioritize tasks.

## 2025-03-29
- **Execution Strategy**: Utils should be inside script folder, unless used for multiple projects.

- **Execution Strategy**: Need to calculate Halstead scores with radon to ensure that code complexity remains low, and if not, refactor module into different classes.

## 2025-04-05
- **AI System Design**: Need to begin taking integration testing more seriously, in order to validate what GUI actions lead to in terms of file operations.
- **AI System Design**: Created project scaffold to enable rapid development of projects.
- **Tooling & Automation**: Will need to flesh out refactor guard to have a lightweight tool capable of assisting with code refactoring suggestions and log creationg for LLM ingestion.
- **AI System Design**: Different design patterns adopted from software engineering principles can be adopted to enable easier maintainability, extensibility and readibility.

- **AI System Design**: Created project scaffold to enable rapid development for other projects.
