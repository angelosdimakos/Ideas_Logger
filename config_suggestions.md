📁 **Module/Package Name:** configuration_cache

  🎯 **Purpose:** Provide an interface to manage and cache configured objects across the application. This module will help reduce redundant configuration loading and improve scalability by reducing disk I/O.

  🛠 **Suggested Integrations:** `load_config`, `get_effective_config`, `reset`

  📝 **Justification:** By introducing a cache layer, we can avoid loading the same configuration multiple times, improving performance and reducing resource consumption. This also simplifies testing by providing a way to mock or replace the cached configuration without affecting other parts of the application.

  📁 **Module/Package Name:** configuration_observers

  🎯 **Purpose:** Register event listeners that react to changes in the loaded configuration. This can be useful for updating dependent modules, reloading data sources, or triggering tests.

  🛠 **Suggested Integrations:** `load_config`, `reset`

  📝 **Justification:** By introducing an observer pattern, we can decouple configuration changes from the modules that need to react to those changes. This promotes a more maintainable and extensible design by making it easy to add new observers or modify existing ones without affecting other parts of the application.

  📁 **Module/Package Name:** configuration_transformers

  🎯 **Purpose:** Apply transformations to the loaded configuration before it is used throughout the application. This can include data validation, normalization, or conversion.

  🛠 **Suggested Integrations:** `load_config`, `get_effective_config`

  📝 **Justification:** By introducing a layer of transformations, we can ensure that the configuration is consistent and validated across the application. This can help reduce bugs caused by incorrect or invalid configuration data and make it easier to maintain and update the configuration in the future.
