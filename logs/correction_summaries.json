This system is intended to enhance the efficiency of a Rapid Annotation and Generalization (RAG) training process by providing high-quality, corrected entries that serve as learning material for the RAG model.\n\nThe AI system architecture includes:\n1. Data Input: The system accepts text inputs from various sources such as documents, websites, or user-generated content.\n2. Processing: Once inputted, the data undergoes preprocessing to ensure it's in a format suitable for analysis and summarization. This may include cleaning, tokenization, and other linguistic transformations.\n3. Model: The heart of the system is an advanced model (in this case, ChatGPT) responsible for generating concise yet comprehensive summaries based on the inputted data.\n4. Review & Edit: To ensure quality and accuracy, the summaries are reviewed and edited by human moderators before being integrated into the RAG training process.\n5. Output: The final output is a well-crafted summary, ready to be utilized for RAG training purposes.\n\nFor efficient operation and reduced dependency on external APIs, an initial plan includes implementing a local Ollama inference pipeline. This will help optimize performance and minimize potential delays associated with third-party API usage.\n\nTo kickstart the process, three initial entries are provided for each subcategory to allow the model to contextualize better and improve early accuracy. The ultimate goal is to accumulate around 100-200 entries to ensure high-quality summaries with minimal corrections.",

For faster context adaptation, the system employs the Rank-Aware Gradient (RAG) method instead of fine-tuning.\n\nThe interaction design focuses on tight command line integration. While Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) are valuable for debugging purposes, they might not be ideal for overall automation in an AI system.\n\nThe system allows the user to utilize various Language Learning Models (LLMs), depending on their computational resources. Users with internet access and weaker computing systems can use OpenAI, while power users can opt for locally-stored LLMs.\n\nLastly, a global config.json file is implemented to facilitate better configuration options with different templates based on the user's specific requirements or use cases. This design aims at creating an adaptable, efficient, and easy-to-configure AI system.",

          "original_summary": "The AI system concept discussed here focuses on the architecture or interaction design of an AI model. To provide a high-quality summary, the AI has been trained using the Recursive Aspectual Generation (RAG) technique. This method ensures the generation of concise and accurate summaries with minimal corrections needed.\n\nInitially, three entries are provided for each subcategory to help the AI understand context better and improve its early accuracy. The aim is to have approximately 100-200 such entries in total.\n\nAdditionally, a planned local Ollama inference pipeline has been designed to reduce dependency on external APIs. This approach ensures faster processing times and enhances system efficiency.\n\nTo further optimize the RAG summarization process, prompt templates have been strategically created, ensuring efficient summarization even with limited context.\n\nIn a comparison between fine-tuning and RAG, it was determined that RAG offers faster adaptation to new contexts due to its ability to generate structured representations of text. This choice allows the AI model to better understand complex information and deliver more accurate results.",
