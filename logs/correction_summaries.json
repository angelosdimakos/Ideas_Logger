This system is intended to enhance the efficiency of a Rapid Annotation and Generalization (RAG) training process by providing high-quality, corrected entries that serve as learning material for the RAG model.\n\nThe AI system architecture includes:\n1. Data Input: The system accepts text inputs from various sources such as documents, websites, or user-generated content.\n2. Processing: Once inputted, the data undergoes preprocessing to ensure it's in a format suitable for analysis and summarization. This may include cleaning, tokenization, and other linguistic transformations.\n3. Model: The heart of the system is an advanced model (in this case, ChatGPT) responsible for generating concise yet comprehensive summaries based on the inputted data.\n4. Review & Edit: To ensure quality and accuracy, the summaries are reviewed and edited by human moderators before being integrated into the RAG training process.\n5. Output: The final output is a well-crafted summary, ready to be utilized for RAG training purposes.\n\nFor efficient operation and reduced dependency on external APIs, an initial plan includes implementing a local Ollama inference pipeline. This will help optimize performance and minimize potential delays associated with third-party API usage.\n\nTo kickstart the process, three initial entries are provided for each subcategory to allow the model to contextualize better and improve early accuracy. The ultimate goal is to accumulate around 100-200 entries to ensure high-quality summaries with minimal corrections.",
