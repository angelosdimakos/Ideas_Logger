1. Module/Package Name: `ai/refactor`
    Purpose: To provide automated refactoring suggestions for code files based on identified issues and top offenders.
    Suggested Integrations: Integrate with existing `ai/summarize`, `ai/extract_top_offenders`, and `ai/build_refactor_prompt` modules.
    Justification: To further automate the code improvement process, refactoring suggestions can be directly generated from the identified issues and top offenders, improving code efficiency and maintainability.

2. Module/Package Name: `ai/test`
    Purpose: To generate test cases for given functions or methods based on their existing functionality and expected behavior.
    Suggested Integrations: Integrate with existing `ai/summarize`, `ai/compute_severity`, and potentially `ai/build_strategic_recommendations_prompt` modules.
    Justification: Automated testing is crucial for ensuring code robustness and reliability. Generating test cases can help developers quickly identify potential bugs or issues in their code, reducing the time spent on manual testing.

3. Module/Package Name: `ai/linting`
    Purpose: To provide linting checks and suggestions to enforce coding standards and best practices within the codebase.
    Suggested Integrations: Integrate with existing `ai/compute_severity`, `ai/build_refactor_prompt`, and potentially `ai/summarize` modules.
    Justification: Linting checks help maintain a consistent coding style, making it easier for developers to collaborate and understand each other's code. By integrating with the existing modules, linting suggestions can be easily generated and acted upon.

4. Module/Package Name: `ai/documentation`
    Purpose: To generate comprehensive documentation for functions, methods, and classes within the codebase.
    Suggested Integrations: Integrate with existing `ai/summarize_module`, `ai/compute_severity`, and potentially `ai/build_strategic_recommendations_prompt` modules.
    Justification: Good documentation is essential for maintaining a well-structured codebase that is easy to understand and maintain. By automatically generating comprehensive documentation, developers can save time and improve the overall quality of their code.
