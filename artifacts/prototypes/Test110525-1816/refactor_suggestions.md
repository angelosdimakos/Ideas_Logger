1. Module/Package Name: `refactor_metrics`
   - Purpose: To provide additional metrics for the refactoring process, such as code smells and architecture complexity.
   - Suggested Integrations: Integrate with existing modules like `ClassMethodInfo`, `ComplexityVisitor`, and `MethodRangeVisitor`. Also, it could use external libraries like `Radon` (for code smells) and ` McCabe` (for architecture complexity).
   - Justification: By adding these metrics, developers can make more informed decisions when refactoring, leading to cleaner and more maintainable code.

2. Module/Package Name: `refactor_testing`
   - Purpose: To automate testing for the refactored code and ensure that changes do not impact functionality negatively.
   - Suggested Integrations: Integration with popular testing frameworks like `unittest`, `pytest`, and `nose`. It could also use continuous integration tools like `Travis CI` or `CircleCI` to run tests automatically on each commit.
   - Justification: Automated testing is crucial in ensuring that refactoring efforts do not introduce unwanted bugs or regressions.

3. Module/Package Name: `refactor_linting`
   - Purpose: To enforce a consistent coding style and adhere to best practices across the project.
   - Suggested Integrations: Integration with linters like `Black`, `Flake8`, and `pycodestyle`. It could also provide a configuration interface for developers to customize their linting rules.
   - Justification: Consistent coding style makes code easier to read, understand, and maintain. Linting helps enforce this consistency across the project.

4. Module/Package Name: `refactor_docs`
   - Purpose: To analyze and improve the quality of documentation in the codebase.
   - Suggested Integrations: Integration with docstring analysis tools like `Sphinx` and `numpydoc`. It could also use natural language processing techniques to suggest improvements to existing documentation.
   - Justification: Good documentation is essential for understanding complex code, especially when working on large projects or collaborating with other developers.

5. Module/Package Name: `refactor_static_analysis`
   - Purpose: To perform static analysis on the codebase, identifying potential security vulnerabilities and antipatterns.
   - Suggested Integrations: Integration with tools like `Bandit`, `OWASP ZAP`, and `Snyk`. It could also provide a configuration interface for developers to customize their analysis rules.
   - Justification: Static analysis can help catch potential security issues early in the development process, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities being introduced into the codebase.
