1. **Role in the System:** The primary role of this module is to provide several functions that facilitate safe interactions with the system, such as executing commands, printing messages under various console encodings, and reading files. It helps simplify common tasks for applications within a system, making them more robust by handling potential errors gracefully.

2. **Key Responsibilities:**
   - `safe_print`: Ensures that messages are printed regardless of exotic console encodings without raising an UnicodeEncodeError. This function helps maintain a consistent output across different systems.
   - `run_cmd`: Executes the specified command, collecting both stdout and stderr into one stream, which is then written to an output file (UTF-8 encoded). Additionally, it returns the subprocess' exit-code, providing information about the success or failure of the executed command. This function is useful for executing commands and capturing their results within an application.
   - `read_report`: Retrieves the textual contents of a file located at *path*. If the file is missing, it returns an empty string instead of raising an exception. The content is decoded as UTF-8; if any bytes cannot be decoded properly, they are replaced with a default character (presumably "replace") to prevent errors from crashing the application. This function helps applications read files without worrying about encoding issues or file existence.

3. **How its parts contribute to the role:** Each function in this module plays a crucial role by handling different aspects of I/O and error management within the system. `safe_print` ensures that messages are always displayed, even under non-standard console encodings, providing consistent output across various systems. `run_cmd` allows applications to execute commands easily and gather their results for further processing, while also returning the exit-code for checking command success or failure. Lastly, `read_report` helps applications read files without worrying about encoding issues or file existence, making it simpler and more robust to handle file I/O tasks.
