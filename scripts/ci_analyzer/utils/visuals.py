This module provides utility functions for rendering visual indicators of code quality and risk scores.

Core features include:
- Rendering a colored bar representation of a score (0â€“100) using emoji blocks.
- Returning an emoji that represents risk level based on a numeric score.

Intended for use in CI reports and dashboards to provide intuitive, visual feedback on code metrics.
