"""
The `refactor` module provides tools for analyzing, comparing, and validating Python code refactoring.

Core functionality includes:
- Comparing original and refactored Python modules or directories to detect changes in class and method definitions.
- Analyzing cyclomatic complexity of functions and methods to ensure maintainability.
- Identifying missing or insufficient test coverage for public methods.
- Integrating with code coverage data to enrich analysis results.
- Supporting configuration for complexity thresholds and file/directory ignore patterns.

This module is intended to help developers and teams maintain code quality and test coverage during refactoring processes.
