### `config/config_loader.py`
This Python module serves as a configuration and logging utility within the system. Its main roles include:

1. Configuring centralized logging through the `setup_logging` function, which sets up the logging level, format, and handlers for the application.
2. Safely loading the configuration file using the `load_config` function. If the config file does not exist or has errors, an empty dictionary is returned.
3. Accessing configuration values through the `get_config_value` function, which returns a default value if the key is not found in the config.
4. Building absolute paths from project-root-relative paths using the `get_absolute_path` function.
5. Checking whether 'test_mode' is enabled in the configuration using the `is_test_mode` function.
6. Loading a modified configuration based on the 'test_mode' setting with `get_effective_config`. This function ensures that tests do not interfere with production data by modifying certain paths in the configuration to point to test-safe equivalents.

In summary, this module provides a consistent and safe way to manage the application's configuration and logging, allowing for flexible and reliable operation in both development and production environments.

### `config/config_manager.py`
This Python module is primarily responsible for managing the application configuration in a systematic manner. It offers several key functionalities to ensure proper loading, handling, and validation of the config file.

1. **Default Configuration (`_default_config`)**: Provides an initial configuration instance that can be used when the configuration file is missing or invalid.

2. **Load Configuration (`load_config`)**: Loads the application's configuration from a JSON file, optionally caching it for future use. If the config file is missing or invalid, it will return a default AppConfig instance instead. It logs relevant events and raises errors during validation while also reloading the config if necessary upon changes to the file or when force_reload is set.

3. **Get Configuration Value (`get_value`)**: Retrieves specific configuration values by key from the loaded AppConfig object.

4. **Reset Configuration (`reset`)**: Resets the cached configuration and timestamp, forcing the module to reload the configuration next time it's accessed.

5. **Validate Config Paths (`validate_config_paths`)**: Verifies that critical configuration directories exist before creating any files within them. It logs warnings for each missing directory and returns True if all required directories exist, otherwise False.

Overall, this module acts as a config manager for the application, ensuring proper loading, handling, and validation of its configuration data while also providing tools to interact with it efficiently and securely within the system.

### `config/logging_setup.py`
The given Python module is primarily responsible for managing logging within an application. It initializes and configures the root logger to enforce a specific log level (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR) across the entire application. By clearing existing handlers, it ensures that only its defined logging configuration remains active.

In addition to setting up the root logger, it adds a console handler with a predefined log message format. This means that all logs produced by the application will be formatted consistently and displayed on the console, providing developers with useful information about the application's behavior and any potential issues that may arise during runtime. The overall role of this module is to ensure effective logging within the system by providing a unified configuration for logging messages.
