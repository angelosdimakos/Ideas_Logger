## core/core.py

The ZephyrusLoggerCore Python module serves as a centralized logging system. Its primary role is to manage, process, and analyze logs within a system. It initializes with necessary configurations and collaborators during instantiation.

The key responsibilities include saving new log entries in both JSON format (for storage) and Markdown (for readability). Additionally, it generates summaries for easy navigation through large volumes of logs, using a FAISS indexer to perform vector searches on summary entries or raw logs for efficient data retrieval.

The module ensures robustness by providing helper functions like _safe_read_json that safely read JSON files and return an empty dictionary in case of errors. This enables the module to continue its operations even when faced with issues during file reading, such as missing files or parsing problems. The search functions ensure that the log analysis is efficient and can handle a large number of entries, making it ideal for complex systems with extensive logging needs.

## core/core_cli.py

This Python module, with functions `log`, `summarize`, and `search`, is designed for system logging and data retrieval. Its primary role lies in maintaining a structured log and enabling efficient data search and summary generation within the logged data.

The `log` function serves as the main interface for recording events, allowing users to log entries categorized under a specific `main` and `sub` category, with the option of logging these entries in both JSON and Markdown formats. This ensures compatibility across different systems and platforms.

The `summarize` function helps users to quickly access information on specific categories or subcategories by automatically generating summaries based on previously logged data. Users can specify a `main` category and a `sub` category, allowing for focused data analysis without having to manually search through large amounts of logs.

Finally, the `search` function enables users to find relevant log entries or summaries using keywords. The `query` parameter allows users to input a search term, while the `top_k` and `kind` parameters determine the number of top results returned and whether to return summary or raw log data, respectively.

By providing an easy-to-use interface for logging, summarizing, and searching system events, this module supports efficient data management and analysis in various applications.

## core/environment_bootstrapper.py

The given Python module, named EnvironmentBootstrapper, is a crucial component in the system it serves. Its primary role is to initialize and set up the environment for proper operation, ensuring necessary directories and files are created and initialized as required.

Key responsibilities include:
1. Initialization of the EnvironmentBootstrapper using specified paths for logs, exports, and configuration, along with a default batch size for processing entries.
2. Bootstrapping the environment through `bootstrap()` by creating necessary directories and initializing required files, setting up default values where necessary.
3. Creating essential directories for logs and exports via the private method `_make_directories()`.
4. Initializing log and configuration files through `_initialize_files()`, creating empty files if they do not exist or preparing them with default values.

In summary, the EnvironmentBootstrapper module acts as a foundation for the system, ensuring all required resources are prepared to facilitate smooth operations within the established environment.

## core/log_manager.py

This Python module, named LogManager, serves as a centralized logging system in the given system. Its primary role is to manage and store logs efficiently, focusing on reading, writing, and updating JSON log files.

Key responsibilities include:
1. Initialization: Creating instances of the LogManager class.
2. File management: Safely reading and creating JSON files, ensuring their integrity and consistency.
3. Data manipulation: Updating JSON data by applying provided functions, such as appending new log entries or updating correction summaries.
4. Data retrieval: Accessing and retrieving batches of unsummarized log entries based on main category and subcategory.

The parts of this module contribute to its role by ensuring that logs are handled in a standardized way, making the system more organized and efficient. The different functions help maintain and manipulate JSON log files, enabling smooth data flow and easy access for further analysis or processing.

## core/markdown_logger.py

This Python module, named `MarkdownLogger`, is designed for logging purposes within a system. Its primary role lies in managing and generating Markdown-formatted logs for easy readability and organization.

The `__init__` function initializes an instance of the logger by defining the directory where all generated Markdown files will be stored. This allows for efficient file management and accessibility across the application.

The key functionality of the module is provided by the `log` function, which adds a new entry to a specific Markdown file based on defined categories (main_category and subcategory) along with a date string as a header. The content of the log entry (entry) is also added to the file.

Overall, the `MarkdownLogger` module streamlines logging in the system by providing an organized, easy-to-read, and easy-to-access solution for developers and other users alike.

## core/summary_engine.py

This Python module, named SummaryEngine, is designed to process and summarize logs in a system. Its primary role is to analyze batches of log entries, identify patterns, and generate concise summaries based on specific categories and subcategories.

The module initializes an instance of the engine (`__init__`) with an AI summarizer, log manager, summary tracker, timestamps format, content key, timestamp key, and batch size. These components work together to manage logs, generate summaries, and keep track of the summarization process.

The `_get_summary` function processes a batch of log entries and generates a summary for the specified subcategory within the context of the given main category. The 'summarize' function sums up log entries for a given main category and subcategory.

Overall, the SummaryEngine plays a crucial role in enhancing the readability and comprehensibility of logs by automatically generating concise summaries based on user-defined categories and subcategories. This allows system administrators and developers to easily understand the system's behavior and identify potential issues more efficiently.

## core/summary_tracker.py

This Python module, referred to as `SummaryTracker`, is a utility for tracking, analyzing, and summarizing log data in a hierarchical structure. Its main role is to provide insights on the usage distribution of different categories within a system by counting and summarizing the logged events.

The `__init__` function initializes the tracker with specified paths, setting up its core components. The tracker consists of two indexers: the `SummaryIndexer` for summarized entries and the `RawLogIndexer` for raw log data.

Functions like `_safe_load_tracker`, `_safe_init_summary_indexer`, and `_safe_init_raw_indexer` are responsible for safely loading, initializing, and maintaining the indexers from storage. The tracker's state can be updated with new data using the `update` function, which incorporates both summarized and new entries counts.

The module offers methods to access various types of data:
- `get_summarized_count` retrieves the count of summarized entries for a given main category and subcategory.
- `get_coverage_data` returns a comprehensive list of coverage data, detailing each tracked (main, sub) category along with logged total, estimated summarized entries, and coverage percentage.

The `rebuild` function resets the current tracker data and re-counts the logged and summarized entries to ensure that the data remains up-to-date. Additionally, the `validate` function verifies the accuracy of the summarized counts by comparing them with the actual counts in correction summaries.

Overall, this `SummaryTracker` module helps developers understand the distribution of user interactions within their system and provides tools for data validation and rebuilding when necessary.
