### `utils/file_utils.py`
This Python module, with the documented functions provided, appears to be a utility module for handling file and directory operations, data serialization (JSON), timestamp generation, and backup functionality. The key role of this module within a system could be managing and storing Python files, ensuring the integrity of their storage locations, and maintaining backup versions of modified files.

The `sanitize_filename`, `get_timestamp`, and `_to_path` functions facilitate proper naming and path management for created or read files. The `safe_path` function ensures the parent directory of a specified path exists, reducing the chance of errors during file operations.

The `write_json`, `read_json`, and `safe_read_json` functions handle serializing and deserializing JSON data, making it easy to store and retrieve complex data structures as text files. The `make_backup` function creates backup versions of modified files, while the `zip_python_files` function gathers all Python source files under a given root directory (excluding specified directories) into a single zip archive, which can help in organizing multiple files and distributing them.

Overall, this module simplifies various file and data operations, contributing to efficient storage, organization, and version control of Python projects within a system.

### `utils/git_utils.py`
This Python module is designed for managing Git repositories within a Python project, focusing on version control and facilitating efficient development workflows. Its key responsibilities involve identifying changed Python files, guiding users through interactive Git commit processes, and providing information about the current Git branch.

The `get_changed_files` function helps developers by automatically determining which Python files have been modified since a specified base branch, ensuring that only relevant files are worked on and committed. By handling compatibility with different Python versions and gracefully returning an empty list if the Git command fails, it ensures the stability of the module.

The `interactive_commit_flow` function streamlines the Git commit process by guiding users through creating and pushing new branches or committing changes to the default branch. This saves time and reduces errors caused by manual Git commands.

Lastly, the `get_current_branch` function provides essential context by informing developers about the current active branch in the local repository, allowing them to better understand their working environment and keep track of their progress. Overall, this Python module simplifies common Git tasks for Python projects, enhancing developer productivity and collaboration.

### `utils/link_summaries_to_raw_logs.py`
This Python module is primarily responsible for managing log data and correction summaries within a system. Its main role is to process raw logs, organize them, and integrate them with correction summaries for efficient analysis.

The key responsibilities of this module include flattening raw log entries across all dates (`flatten_raw_entries`) and injecting the relevant raw log entries into each batch of correction summaries based on their labels (`inject_entries_into_summaries`). By doing so, it enables better understanding of the relationships between logs and corrections in a chronological order.

This module also handles configuration reading to determine file paths, reads both raw logs and correction summaries, and ensures that relevant raw entries are extracted and injected into their corresponding batches in the summaries. The updates made to the summaries files are saved in-place, allowing for streamlined data processing and analysis within the system.

### `utils/zip_util.py`
This Python module is primarily designed for managing and archiving Python projects from the command line. Its key responsibility lies in parsing input parameters, identifying .py files within a project structure, excluding specific directories as specified, and creating a ZIP archive containing those files. The `main` function acts as the entry point, initiating the process by calling an internal utility responsible for actual archiving. Logging the output path ensures users are aware of where their generated archive is located. This module streamlines the common task of project archival, contributing to the overall efficiency and organization of a Python development environment.
